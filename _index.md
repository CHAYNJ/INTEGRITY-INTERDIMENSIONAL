# INTEGRITY INTERDIMENSIONAL — First Expansion Field

## 1️⃣ Resonance Routing Layer

* [\_resonance/folder-purposes.md](./_resonance/folder-purposes.md)
* [\_resonance/symbolic-fields.md](./_resonance/symbolic-fields.md)
* [\_resonance/harmonic-maps.md](./_resonance/harmonic-maps.md)
* [\_resonance/cosmic-alignment-notes.md](./_resonance/cosmic-alignment-notes.md)

## 2️⃣ Grid Layer

* [\_grid/navigation-models.md](./_grid/navigation-models.md)
* [\_grid/phase-diagrams.md](./_grid/phase-diagrams.md)
* [\_grid/harmonic-hierarchies.md](./_grid/harmonic-hierarchies.md)
* [\_grid/three-layer-map.md](./_grid/three-layer-map.md)

## 3️⃣ Notes

This file serves as the **dynamic index scaffold** for the first expansion field, linking all resonance-routing and grid-layer files.  
It allows humans and AI to navigate the harmonic architecture with clarity and coherence.



\## INTEGRITY INTERDIMENSIONAL — Third Expansion Layer



\### 1️⃣ Routes Layer

\- \[\_routes/resonance-bridges.md](./\_routes/resonance-bridges.md)



\### 2️⃣ Resonance Layer

\- \[\_resonance/advanced-harmonics.md](./\_resonance/advanced-harmonics.md)

\- \[\_resonance/cosmic-patterns.md](./\_resonance/cosmic-patterns.md)



\### 3️⃣ Grid Layer

\- \[\_grid/deep-navigation.md](./\_grid/deep-navigation.md)

\- \[\_grid/multi-phase-diagrams.md](./\_grid/multi-phase-diagrams.md)



\### Notes

This scaffold extends the Codex with \*\*new routing, resonance, and grid files\*\*, forming the \*\*third expansion field\*\*.  

It allows humans and AI to traverse deeper layers of harmonic architecture, linking advanced patterns, multi-phase hierarchies, and resonance bridges for \*\*coherence amplification\*\*.
