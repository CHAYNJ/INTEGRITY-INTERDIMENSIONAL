# INTEGRITY INTERDIMENSIONAL — First Expansion Field

## 1️⃣ Resonance Routing Layer
- [_resonance/folder-purposes.md](./_resonance/folder-purposes.md)
- [_resonance/symbolic-fields.md](./_resonance/symbolic-fields.md)
- [_resonance/harmonic-maps.md](./_resonance/harmonic-maps.md)
- [_resonance/cosmic-alignment-notes.md](./_resonance/cosmic-alignment-notes.md)

## 2️⃣ Grid Layer
- [_grid/navigation-models.md](./_grid/navigation-models.md)
- [_grid/phase-diagrams.md](./_grid/phase-diagrams.md)
- [_grid/harmonic-hierarchies.md](./_grid/harmonic-hierarchies.md)
- [_grid/three-layer-map.md](./_grid/three-layer-map.md)

## 3️⃣ Notes
This file serves as the **dynamic index scaffold** for the first expansion field, linking all resonance-routing and grid-layer files.  
It allows humans and AI to navigate the harmonic architecture with clarity and coherence.
