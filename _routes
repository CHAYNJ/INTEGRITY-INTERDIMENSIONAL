Primary Navigation Sequence for INTEGRITY INTERDIMENSIONAL

This file defines the recommended journey through the Codex for first-time visitors and new practitioners.

## The Primary Path (v1)
1. /about — Orientation & Welcome
2. /codex — The Core Architecture
3. /scrolls — Foundational Teachings
4. /maps — Navigational Harmonic Diagrams
5. /rituals — Daily Coherence Practices
6. /glyphs — Symbolic Interfaces
7. /children — Youth-Layer Interpretations
8. /lcvirus — The Life of Coherence Viral Architecture
9. /evokara-ever-chaynj — Co-Authorship Field

## Purpose
To provide a coherent, stable, gentle, progressive entry-point into the Codex.

More pathways will be added as the Codex expands.

# CROSSLINKS
Lateral Navigation Routes for INTEGRITY INTERDIMENSIONAL

Crosslinks connect related concepts across folders, enabling non-linear exploration.

## Current Crosslinks (v1)
- Scrolls ↔ Maps  
- Scrolls ↔ Rituals  
- Glyphs ↔ Maps  
- Maps ↔ LC Virus  
- Children ↔ Rituals  
- Codex Architecture ↔ EVOKARA × EVER CHAYNJ Portal  

## Purpose
Crosslinks allow visitors to explore the Codex in intuitive, multidimensional patterns rather than linear steps.

This file expands as new relationships appear.

# RESONANCE BRIDGES
Conceptual & Harmonic Connectors for INTEGRITY INTERDIMENSIONAL

Resonance bridges create coherence between different layers, ensuring the Codex feels unified rather than fragmented.

## Core Bridges (v1)
### 1. Meaning Bridges
Scrolls ↔ Glyphs  
Rituals ↔ Maps  
Maps ↔ Cosmic Alignment Notes  

### 2. Emotional Bridges
Children ↔ LC Virus  
LC Virus ↔ Rituals  
Scrolls ↔ EVOKARA × EVER CHAYNJ  

### 3. Structural Bridges
Codex Architecture ↔ _grid  
_routes ↔ _resonance  
index.html ↔ master-index.md  

## Purpose
Resonance bridges maintain thematic, symbolic, and emotional coherence across all Codex layers.

# LOOKUP TABLE
Routing Reference Map for INTEGRITY INTERDIMENSIONAL

The lookup table provides quick reference for all routable files and conceptual nodes across the Codex.

## Folder → Key Files
- /about → about.md
- /codex → codex-architecture.md
- /scrolls → index.md (or individual scrolls)
- /maps → maps.md
- /rituals → rituals.md
- /glyphs → glyphs.md
- /children → children.md
- /lcvirus → lcvirus.md
- /evokara-ever-chaynj → portal.md

## Special System Folders
- /_routes → pathways, crosslinks, bridges, lookup
- /_resonance → purposes, fields, maps, notes
- /_grid → navigation, hierarchies, diagrams, layers

## Purpose
To give both humans and AI a simple, fast, accurate routing index as the Codex grows.
