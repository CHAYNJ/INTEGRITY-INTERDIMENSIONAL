# Children — INTEGRITY INTERDIMENSIONAL Repository

## **Purpose**
The `children` folder contains **child-friendly versions of the BLAKOKOD Aquarian Codex content**, designed to introduce younger humans to harmonic principles, emotional recursion, and symbolic awareness in a playful, understandable way. These materials are simplified, engaging, and visually rich to make harmonic learning accessible to all ages.

This file serves as an **index and guide** for all child-focused content within the repository.
