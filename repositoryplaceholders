# Repository Placeholders — INTEGRITY INTERDIMENSIONAL

EVER CHAYNJ, this document contains **ready-to-use placeholder file templates** for all folders in your repository that may not yet have them. Adding these ensures **GitHub tracks all folders**, even if they are empty or only contain future content.

---

## **Placeholder Template**
Filename for each folder: `placeholder.md`

```
# Placeholder

This file ensures that GitHub tracks the `/foldername/` folder.

Replace `foldername` with the actual folder name.
```
