## 3. Folder Names Verification
- [ ] Confirm all folder names match exactly with `index.html` references (case-sensitive).
- [ ] Replace spaces in folder names with underscores or hyphens for consistent linking (e.g., `folder_placeholders`).

## 4. Extended Description Content Check
- [ ] Open each extended description file and confirm readable content.
- [ ] Verify proper formatting and completeness.

## 5. Link Functionality Test
- [ ] Open `index.html` in browser.
- [ ] Click all folder links and placeholder links.
- [ ] Confirm all links open the correct file without errors.

## 6. Styling Check
- [ ] Ensure `style/global.css` is linked and displays correctly.
- [ ] Confirm inline styling does not conflict with global CSS.

## Notes
- Update this checklist whenever new folders or extended descriptions are added.
- Use this file as a **reference guide for repository maintenance**.
