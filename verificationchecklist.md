A Complete Field Audit for Repository Coherence

This checklist ensures that every folder, file, and harmonic element in the INTEGRITY-INTERDIMENSIONAL Codex is properly created, populated, and aligned.
Use this list before publishing major updates, adding new scrolls, or activating new coherence protocols.

1. CORE FILES — Confirm Presence & Health
